# jspm-starter

A JSPM based project skeleton which leverages babel (with es7.decorators and es7.classproperties) Sass (with bourbon and neat) and Gulp (for build/serve/test tasks).

## Setup

 - clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/darcnite3000/jspm-starter
```

 - Update the package json (change the name, author details)

 - Install the node modules and jspm modules

```
npm install && jspm install
```


## Acknowledgements

Parts of this have been liberally lifted from the [aurelia skeleton](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation) modified to be more generic and compatable with a standard es6/7 setup.
